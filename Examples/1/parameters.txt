## Space
- LISTOFPROBABILITIES: [0.1, 0.75, 0.05, 0.03, 0.15] (Probability of transfer of salmonella per zone)
- GRIDSIZE: [1000.0, 1000.0] (Size of the grid)
- MAX_MOVE: 25 (Maximum move value)
- MEAN_MOVE: 5 (Mean move value)
- STD_MOVE: 10 (Standard deviation of move value)

## Disease
- TRANSFER_DISTANCE: 1 (Maximum distance for disease transmission)

## Collection
- AGE_OF_HOSTCOLLECTION: 25 days
- AGE_OF_DEPOSITCOLLECTION: 1 days
- FAECAL_CLEANUP_FREQUENCY: 6 times per day

## Import parameters
-const PROBABILITY_OF_INFECTION:f64 = 0.1; //probability of imported host being infected
const MEAN_AGE:f64 = 5.0*24.0; //Mean age of hosts imported (IN HOURS)
const STD_AGE:f64 = 3.0*24.0;//Standard deviation of host age (when using normal distribution)
const MAX_AGE:f64 = 11.0*24.0; //Maximum age of host accepted (Note: as of now, minimum age is 0.0)
const DEFECATION_RATE:f64 = 1.0; //Number times a day host is expected to defecate
const DEPOSIT_RATE:f64 = 1.0; //Number of times a day host is expected to deposit a consumable deposit

## Resolution
- STEP: 20 (Chickens per unit distance)
- HOUR_STEP: 4 (Chickens move per hour)
- LENGTH: 720 (Simulation duration in hours)
